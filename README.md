# *“For hypothesis 1, we predict that daily discrimination will increase negative affect, which, concordant with prior research, will increase craving and subsequent substance use. # Discrimination is also predicted to increase substance use directly. To test this, we will test MLMs with discrimination as a level-1 predictor, and negative affect and craving as level-1 # outcomes. I hypothesize that daily experiences of discrimination will increase negative affect and subsequent craving in line with stress generation models. To test this hypothesis, discrimination will be examined as a predictor of negative affect and craving, such that each outcome variable is lagged by one EMA assessment occasion (e.g., discrimination at Time 2 predicting negative affect at Time 3). To ensure appropriate understanding of these variables for Latine participants, I will examine U.S. nativity and fears of deportation as level-2 covariates and cross-level moderators. To ensure adequate consideration of gender, it will also be examined as a cross-level moderator. The cross-level effects will be tested in accordance with recommendations by Preacher and colleagues (Preacher et al., 2006) in that the random slopes measuring the effect of discrimination on negative affect, craving, and substance use will be examined as a level-2 (between- participant) outcome. We will then examine gender, U.S. nativity, and fears of deportation (if feasible) as predictors of these random slopes. Note that US nativity and fears of deportation were not analyzed due to having so few data on it.*

##NRSA Hypo 2 HSBANY.R 
  #script for hypothesis 2 with HSBANY ("have you sought ANY treatment for your substance use this past week?") We had more complete data for this question, albeit not much variability as most     #were "0" (No).
